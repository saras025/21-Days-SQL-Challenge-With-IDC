# 💾 21 Days IDC Challenge: SQL Mastery

**"21 days to turn SQL commands into second nature."**

This repository documents my journey through the **21-Day SQL Challenge** (IDC = **I Dig Columns**!). The goal is consistent, daily practice to master foundational to intermediate SQL concepts.

---

## 🎯 The Core Challenge

* **Duration:** 21 Consecutive Days (Commit to a start date!).

### 🔑 Key Concepts to Master

For this challenge, I will focus on reinforcing these fundamentals:

* **Tables** store data in rows (records) and columns (fields).
* **SELECT** defines which columns to retrieve.
* **FROM** specifies which table to query.
* Use **semicolon (;)** to end SQL statements.

## 📜 How to Track Progress (The Rules)

1.  **Daily Log & Query:** I will post a log of my progress and the SQL query I worked on **every single day** in my personal log file.
2.  **Location:** All daily updates will be located in the `/Daily-Logs` folder.
3.  **Accountability:** Missing two days in a row means restarting the challenge from Day 1!
4.  **Proof:** Each log entry must include the day's main **SQL query** and a brief explanation of the result.
